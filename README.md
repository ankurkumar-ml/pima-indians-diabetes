# Pima-Indians-Diabetes
Developed a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

## Install

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
- [Numpy]()
- [Pandas]()
- [Matplotlib]()
- [Seaborn]()
- [scikit-learn]()

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook]()

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda]() distribution of Python, which already haa above packages and more included.



## Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Data Description
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
